abstract = {Acne is a chronic skin condition that happens to most teenagers at the age of 12 and 25. Several types of acne are found as non-inflammatory and inflammatory skin disease. As the number of people facing acne problems increasing and there is the need to have an automated application for recognizing acne, this study proposed a mobile-based application that able to recognizes acne types. This study used the Deep Learning technology method, YOLOv4 in detecting and recognizing acne. There are four types of acne covered in this study which are cyst, papule, pustule, and whitehead. The dataset used for the purpose of training and testing the model is from the DermNet NZ dataset. Based on the testing conducted, the application achieved 91.25% average of accuracy. It is believe, the integration of YOLO with any existing Deep Learning approach could improve the recognition rate in future.}

  abstract = {Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory disease — rather than a natural part of the life cycle as colloquially viewed — of the pilosebaceous unit (comprising the hair follicle, hair shaft and sebaceous gland) and is among the most common dermatological conditions worldwide. Some of the key mechanisms involved in the development of acne include disturbed sebaceous gland activity associated with hyperseborrhoea (that is, increased sebum production) and alterations in sebum fatty acid composition, dysregulation of the hormone microenvironment, interaction with neuropeptides, follicular hyperkeratinization, induction of inflammation and dysfunction of the innate and adaptive immunity. Grading of acne involves lesion counting and photographic methods. However, there is a lack of consensus on the exact grading criteria, which hampers the conduction and comparison of randomized controlled clinical trials evaluating treatments. Prevention of acne relies on the successful management of modifiable risk factors, such as underlying systemic diseases and lifestyle factors. Several treatments are available, but guidelines suffer from a lack of data to make evidence-based recommendations. In addition, the complex combination treatment regimens required to target different aspects of acne pathophysiology lead to poor adherence, which undermines treatment success. Acne commonly causes scarring and reduces the quality of life of patients. New treatment options with a shift towards targeting the early processes involved in acne development instead of suppressing the effects of end products will enhance our ability to improve the outcomes for patients with acne.}

    abstract = {Acne vulgaris is an inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit of the skin that primarily involves the face and trunk and affects approximately 9\% of the population worldwide (approximately 85\% of individuals aged 12-24 years, and approximately 50\% of patients aged 20-29 years). Acne vulgaris can cause permanent physical scarring, negatively affect quality of life and self-image, and has been associated with increased rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation.Acne vulgaris is classified based on patient age, lesion morphology (comedonal, inflammatory, mixed, nodulocystic), distribution (location on face, trunk, or both), and severity (extent, presence or absence of scarring, postinflammatory erythema, or hyperpigmentation). Although most acne does not require specific medical evaluation, medical workup is sometimes warranted. Topical therapies such as retinoids (eg, tretinoin, adapalene), benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, and/or combinations of topical agents are first-line treatments. When prescribed as a single therapy in a randomized trial of 207 patients, treatment with tretinoin 0.025\% gel reduced acne lesion counts at 12 weeks by 63\% compared with baseline. Combinations of topical agents with systemic agents (oral antibiotics such as doxycycline and minocycline, hormonal therapies such as combination oral contraception [COC] or spironolactone, or isotretinoin) are recommended for more severe disease. In a meta-analysis of 32 randomized clinical trials, COC was associated with reductions in inflammatory lesions by 62\%, placebo was associated with a 26\% reduction, and oral antibiotics were associated with a 58\% reduction at 6-month follow-up. Isotretinoin is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating severe recalcitrant nodular acne but is often used to treat resistant or persistent moderate to severe acne, as well as acne that produces scarring or significant psychosocial distress.Acne vulgaris affects approximately 9\% of the population worldwide and approximately 85\% of those aged 12 to 24 years. First-line therapies are topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, or combinations of topicals. For more severe disease, oral antibiotics such as doxycycline or minocycline, hormonal therapies such as combination oral conceptive agents or spironolactone, or isotretinoin are most effective.},

abstract = {Skin is one of the most significant organs, which serves as a barrier to the outside surroundings of the human body. To improve mortality, skin disease detection at a prior stage is necessary else it may convert to skin cancer. But its diagnosis at the prior stage that may increase life expectancy is a great experiment since it has a similar look to skin diseases. To deal with biomedical images, a new innovative automated system is required that can quickly and precisely identify skin lesions. Deep Learning is attracting a lot of attention in the treatment of numerous disorders. A fusion model is proposed here with the integration of the U-Net and Convolution Neural Network model. For this, the U-Net model has been utilized to segment the diseases using skin images and the Convolution Neural Network model has been proposed for the multi-class classification of segmented images. The model is simulated and analyzed using the HAM10000 dataset having 10,015 dermoscopy images of seven different classifications of skin diseases. The proposed model has been analyzed using two optimizers i.e. Adam and Adadelta on 20 epochs and 32 batch sizes for the skin disease classification. The model has outperformed on Adadelta optimizer with an accuracy value of 97.96%.}

abstract = {Melanoma is a dangerous skin cancer and spreads very fast. Hence, it is the deadliest skin cancer and causes most deaths. Classification of cancer stages is a very tedious task and very important when a patient is diagnosed. Diagnosis of cancer at the surgical treatment time mainly depends on the stage of cancer or tumor thickness. In this paper, two methods are designed to classify melanoma cancer stages. The first system classifies melanoma as stage 1 and stage 2. Second system classifies melanoma as stage 1, stage 2 or stage 3 melanoma. The proposed system uses convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm with Similarity Measure for Text Processing (SMTP) as loss function. The experimental results with different loss functions are demonstrated and compared with proposed SMTP loss function. The proposed algorithm is more efficient than several other loss functions that are specifically designed for the classification problem.}

abstract = {Acne vulgaris is a chronic skin condition caused by blockage or inflammation of the hair follicles and their associated sebaceous glands – together known as the pilosebaceous units. It typically affects areas with the highest density of sebaceous follicles; this includes the face, upper chest and back. Although all age groups can be affected, it is primarily a disorder of adolescence. It can present as non-inflammatory comedones (blackheads, whiteheads), inflammatory papules, pustules, nodules and cysts, or a mixture of lesions. This can result in symptoms of local tenderness and erythema. Acne is extremely common and thought to affect most people at some point in their lives. Twenty per cent progress to severe acne, which can lead to permanent scarring. The condition can be associated with significant psychosocial complications including low self-esteem, altered body image, social isolation and depression. The aims of treatment are to prevent long-term complications.}
